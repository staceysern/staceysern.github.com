Much of the work of documenting the Twisted Mail API has involved searching
through the Python code to determine the types for parameters and return values.
It often involves comparing functions in different classes which inherit from
the same base class or implement the same interface.
In some cases, I've resorted to looking at unit tests or example code to see 
how objects are used.
After a recent experience while tracking down types, I'm more convinced than 
ever of the value of the API documentation.

I was documenting the `alias` module, which contains classes for redirecting
mail from one user to another user, to a file, to a process, and to a group of 
aliases. Four different classes inherit from the base class `AliasBase` 
and implement the interface `IAlias`, which contains the function 
`createMessageReceiver`.
The class hierarchy looks like this:

<pre>
twisted.mail.alias.AliasBase
    twisted.mail.alias.AddressAlias
    twisted.mail.alias.AliasGroup
    twisted.mail.alias.FileAlias
    twisted.mail.alias.ProcessAlias
</pre>

I was trying to determine the return value of `IAlias.createMessageReceiver`.
The return value was clear for three of the four classes that implement
`IAlias` because the object to be returned was created in the return statement.

<pre>
FileAlias -> FileWrapper 
ProcessAlias -> MessageWrapper   
AliasGroup -> MultiWrapper 
</pre>

The objects returned are all message receivers which implement the 
`smtp.IMessage` interface.  They deliver a message to the appropriate place:
a file, a process or a group of message receivers.
It seemed pretty clear that the return value of the `createMessageReceiver`
function in the `IAlias` interface should be `smtp.IMessage`.
However, there was one more class that implemented the interface,
`AddressAlias`, and the return value from that wasn't so clear.

``` python
class AddressAlias(AliasBase):
    implements(IAlias)

    def __init__(self, alias, *args):
        AliasBase.__init__(self, *args)
        self.alias = smtp.Address(alias)

    def createMessageReceiver(self):
        return self.domain().exists(str(self.alias))
```

`AddressAlias.createMessageReceiver` returns the result of a call to `exists`
on the result of a call to `domain`.
`domain` is a base class function which returns an object which implements the 
`IDomain` interface.
Fortunately, the `IDomain` interface was documented.
It returns a callable which takes no arguments and returns an object
implementing `IMessage`.
Unfortunately, this return value didn't match the pattern of the other three 
classes implementing `IAlias.createMessageReceiver`, all of which return an
object implementing `IMessage`.

Although messy, it was possible that the return value of
`IAlias.createMessageReceiver`
was either an `smtp.IMessage` provider or a callable which takes no arguments
and returns an `smtp.IMessage` provider.
Or, it might have been a mistake.

At this point, I fortuitously happened to be looking at this code in an old
branch and noticed a difference. There, the
`AddressAlias.createMessageReceiver` function appeared as follows:

``` python
def createMessageReceiver(self): 
    return self.domain().startMessage(str(self.alias)) 
```

After some investigation, I found a
[ticket](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4151#4151) that had been fixed 
earlier this year to remove calls to the deprecated `IDomain.startMessage`
function.
In the old code, `startMessage` also returns an `IMessage` provider.
So, it seemed that a bug had been introduced in the switch from `startMessage` 
to `exists`.

The result of the call to `exists` must be invoked to get the proper message
receiver to return. The code should read: 

``` python
def createMessageReceiver(self): 
    return self.domain().exists(User(self.alias), None, None, None)()
```

I filed a [ticket](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/6638#6638) in the 
issue tracking system and subsequently submitted a fix. 
While reworking the unit tests, I relied heavily on the API documentation I had
written for the `alias` module.
I think it's safe to say that had the API been fully documented when the 
original change was made, this error would have been easy to spot during code 
review or to avoid in the first place.
